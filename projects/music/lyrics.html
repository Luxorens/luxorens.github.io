    <h3 id="eternalbliss">Eternal Bliss Lyrics</h3>
    <h5>Do you know what I want</h5>
    <h5>I don't know what you want</h5>
    <h5>Walking around in a circle</h5>
    <h5>Hoping for some kind of miracle</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>I donâ€™t know you</h5>
    <h5>I can't read your thoughts</h5>
    <h5>I can't read your wants</h5>
    <h5>I just can't read you</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>I am in too deep</h5>
    <h5>Still can't see the shining beam</h5>
    <h5>Can't seem to sleep</h5>
    <h5>When I see you in my dream</h5> 
    <h5>I'm done, done waiting around</h5> 
    <h5>But I still have to stay around</h5>
    <h5>Don't be alarmed when I say this</h5> 
    <h5>You're my eternal bliss</h5> 
    <br>
    <h5>[ INSTRUMENTAL PART ]</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Hey buddy, is it true</h5>
    <h5>The way she acts with you</h5>
    <h5>Can't help but shake the feeling</h5>
    <h5>with the way you've been acting</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Guess it's not true</h5>
    <h5>I hope it's not true</h5>
    <h5>It's not true</h5>
    <h5>It's not true</h5>
    <h5>Not true</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>She wants him and he wants me</h5>
    <h5>They just can't seem to make it work</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>I am in too deep</h5>
    <h5>Still can't see the shining beam</h5>
    <h5>Can't seem to sleep</h5>
    <h5>When I see you in my dream</h5> 
    <h5>I'm done, done waiting around</h5> 
    <h5>But I still have to stay around</h5>
    <h5>Don't be alarmed when I say this</h5> 
    <h5>You're my eternal bliss</h5> 
    <br>

    <h3 id="paranoid">Paranoid Cover Lyrics</h3>
    <h5>Finished with my woman cause she couldn't help me with my mind</h5>
    <h5>People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy</h5>
    <h5>Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Can you help me?</h5>
    <h5>Occupy my brain</h5>
    <h5>Oh yeah</h5>   
    <br>
    <h5>I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find</h5>
    <h5>I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>[ GUITAR SOLO ]</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry</h5>
    <h5>Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state</h5>
    <h5>I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late</h5>
    <br>
    <br>
